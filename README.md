## Single Sign-On (SSO) with Oauth and SAML

### SSO
SSO (Single Sign On) occurs when a user logs in to one Client and is then signed in to other Clients automatically, regardless of the platform, technology, or domain the user is using.

Single sign-on (SSO) is a session and user authentication service that permits a user to use one set of login credentials (e.g., name and password) to access multiple applications.
The service authenticates the end user for all the applications the user has been given rights to and eliminates further prompts when the user switches applications during the same session.

**A good example of the use of SSO is in Googleâ€™s services. You need only be signed in to one primary Google account to access different services like YouTube, Gmail, Google+, Google Analytics, and more.**
